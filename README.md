# Reboot the retreat? For the planet!


Each year, the Champalimaud Research community comes together to learn and celebrate with a retreat. Its purpose is to help us to work better together and to foster a positive and inclusive culture that reflects our common values. These goals are ever more vital as the CR grows and becomes ever more diverse in its scientific focus.
This year, it is harder than ever to ignore that our research takes place on a planet that is out of balance. The environment may not be the point of our work, but for how long can we afford to continue to ignore it? Without action from each one of us to address human impact on our environment, the value of our research to the future is hardly clear.
In the context of this crisis, we propose an entirely new challenge.

**We propose to reboot and rebuild the retreat to reflect a more sustainable balance with nature.**
