# Theme camp guide

## Summary
Community theme camps are the main organizational unit of the retreat.

Camps are focused around a theme and related events that they organize. The process of camp formation is an important community-building effort aiming to allow people to gather according to their preferences while achieving inclusivity and diversity within camps. Camps are responsible for setting up a camping area, possibly including a structure for the events they will organize, and for leaving no trace of these areas after the event. Each person coming to the retreat will join one camp and participate in some of its activities and volunteer duties, but there will be  plenty of time to join the activities of other camps.
As this retreat will be built by the community, the volunteering duties will be essential for the functioning of the human ecosystem. However, as work is expected to be evenly distributed by everyone, each person will end up not having to do that much work!

## Idea generation
Before and during the camp registration process ideas for camp themes should be available to the community to give inspiration and ideas.

A physical bulletin board will be a place where:
  - The general camp structure is depicted
  - Ideas for themes can be posted

A description of each registered camp should be available to inspire others:
- On-line where the registration form is linked
- On the bulletin board

## Registration
To register a camp, the following are needed:
 - A camp name
 - A theme and a preliminary plan for activities (see below)
 - 5 founders who have agree to take the camp leadership roles (below)

To foster diversity, no more than 2 founders should be from one lab or group (platform, admin unit, etc)


## Matching
To foster inclusivity and diversity, a matching system (see below) will be used to join people to camps.
To allow for people to be with some preferred friends, groups of up to 3 people may join together as a unit for the purpose of matching.
Once the camps are formed, each person or group that is not in the founders of a camp ranks their camp preferences (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc) by a form.
The Community circle assigns them to a camp taking into account those preferences plus the aim of having a diverse mix of people with respect to labs, departments and other qualities such as country of origin.

To keep the camp cosy, the maximum anticipated size is 20 people.

## Families
(suggestion) Kids camp
Maybe spreading out this throughout the camps
What are the conditions for families to join?
Encouraging families to come as a unit in a camp - restrictions regarding lab membership would not apply
Asking camps if they have kid oriented activities?
Maybe making it mandatory that a camp would have a kids activity?

## Lead roles
A camp has 5 leadership roles, or ‘leads’, corresponding to the 5 main circles of the retreat. Leads do not run the camp or do all the work in the camp; they facilitate its functioning whilst also participating in a reasonable amount of daily tasks. These persons provide the links between the camp and the broader organization; they also sit on the corresponding retreat-wide circles. Each lead may recruit one or more co-leads if they wish. It’s important to remember that these roles are for leadership and organizing camp members, who are all expected to contribute to each of the 5 areas.

- `Organization:` overall responsible for making sure the camp is working, including recruiting the other 4 lead roles (and keeping them filled); manages the camp budget
- `Community:` responsible for facilitating communication within the camp, including organizing the camp’s communication link (email, Slack, etc.); moderating camp meetings
- `Environment:` responsible for organizing volunteers for camp set-up and clean-up (leave no trace), including any structures the camp is building; monitor camps environmental impact; coordinate with Environment circle on event-wide electrical, building or environmental issues
- `Food:` responsible for organizing volunteers for cooking & cleaning and leading any camp cooking or food sharing
- `Events` (action): responsible for the organizing the camp’s theme-related activities; coordinate with Events circle for the camps AV needs and for event scheduling

## Overall responsibilities

Each camp is responsible for:

- `Community:` providing a friendly, respectful and inclusive environment for its members and guests
- `Environment:` Taking care of its own garbage and keeping its space tidy
- `Shelter:` Setting up a sleeping area with tents, shade structure, waste bins, lighting, etc.
- `Events:` Organizing one or more events or activities according to its theme
- `Food:` Providing volunteers for central activities, like cooking
- `Communication:` linking with the main circles to coordinate central activities

## Organization

- Budget: A camp will receive a budget. The camp Organizer is responsible for the budget, in coordination with the Organization circle.
- Transport:
- Communication link: We have a Slack and each camp has a channel

## Community

Guidelines for making a friendly camp
Conflict resolution

## Environment & shelter

A camp is responsible for a camping area and the natural landscape in its surroundings.
The camp environment lead is responsible for the following items:
Coordination of the sleeping arrangements for all the members of the camp. This implies figuring out which members will take their own tents/sleeping arrangements and which members will require the purchasing of a tent through the camp budget.
Defining the layout of the tents. A camp should have a social shaded area as a minimum infrastructure.
Organizing waste management amongst the camp and ensuring that the camp area is well preserved.

### Important notes:

Any trash found on the camp area should be picked up and put in its respective garbage container.
In case the camp decides to have an hygiene station (basic hygiene such as washing teeth) the water residues should not be released on the camp site but instead into a grey water container.

One of the main goals of the camp in the environmental section is of Leaving no Trace. However you found your little corner in nature, leave it as it was or even better.

## Events & theme

Each camp will have a different focus or theme and will take responsibility for sharing activities or events related to that theme. Ideas for possible themes are [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rCWdoYY8xhT6-a8HKGNBsO9SUenCQf2E9arFwYNmjU0/edit#gid=0).
Each camp may request a budget to develop its activities.
Camp activities have to keep in mind the overall theme of the retreat-- Being Ecological (future link).
The Events lead of the camp is responsible for organizing and facilitating the camp events. This is one of the most important roles in the camp and, as with the other leads, must be identified when the circle is formed. The Events lead may have one or more co-leads to share the leadership responsibilities and is expected to recruit volunteers from within the camp to help them. The Events lead is not meant to be the sole person working to put on an event.

The general responsibilities are:
1. Preparation of the events, which should begin well in advance
2. Coordinate the location and timing of the events, with Events circle through the **Master Schedule**
3. Interface with the Central Circle events lead for audiovisual (AV) equipment requests
4. Set-up space for the events with either the Camp Environment Lead
5. Running of the event itself and managing the necessary volunteers
6. Take-down and clean-up of the event (leave no trace) also in coordination with the Environment Lead

An event may be a variety of things that can be shared with others:
- A talk or presentation to listen to and learn
- A workshop to learn a skill or practice
- A performance or show to entertain
- A discussion group on a given topic
- Building something to share
- Organizing a game of any kind
- Leading an activity like a walk, a yoga session or simply providing some music ambience
- Preparing something to give to others, like food, drink or jokes

Events will be located either in
1. The Centre Stage: a shelter big enough for the entire group (15 x 20 m), with stage, AV & lighting, centrally coordinated. This is appropriate for events like talks, workshops, performance, etc.
2. A smaller structure: most camps will have available a smaller shelter (approx 4 x 4 m?), appropriate for smaller group discussions, small workshops, games, etc.
A camp may if needed recruit members from other camps to assist in putting on their events, e.g. a talk.

## Events Schedule

Events circle is responsible for scheduling the timing and location of events.
An event timetable and location map will be generated after all proposals for events are finalized. This requires that all camps finalize their proposals up to a certain deadline.
This map will serve the whole community so that people are able to choose to which events they want to take part in. The schedule will be released before the retreat so that people are able to organize volunteering around the events they want to partake in.
A camp can organize as many events as they seem feasible and simultaneous events can happen during the retreat in a similar manner to how workshops were done in the CR Retreat 2019.
However, as there is a finite number of people, take into account that the attendance to a camp event might be dependent on other events, so camps should communicate before the retreat in order to avoid too many events taking place in a single time slot!
