The CR retreat has always allowed us to escape to a beautiful natural setting like the Alentejo countryside. But convening as we do at a comfortable hotel like the Vila GalÃ© Clube Campo for **3 days implies** a carbon footprint of order 50 t, about **4000% (40 times) our recommended carbon allowance** of 1.23 t (see *).


*Can we help foster our community while also re-envisioning the retreat as a sustainable gathering?*

*Can we contribute our creativity and problem-solving skills to the urgent question of how we can live on our finite planet?*

To address these questions, we propose to build our retreat, ourselves, from the bottom up.
By researching and taking responsibility for our own temporary village, we will create a more autonomous space that reflects who we are as a scientific community. By doing so in light of our awareness of environmental impact, we will create one that better reflects what we can afford to ask of the planet. By leaving little trace as we can, we will confront our needs and our relationship with the Earth in a way that we are not normally accustomed to.
Would you like to help contribute to this mission?
Achieving this vision will take more active participation from our community at every step of the way. Actually putting our hands and minds together for a common project is perhaps the best way we can help our community.
With many small efforts, we can not only help to make an inspiring event, but help us bring important knowledge into our daily lives, help motivate our friends and colleagues, and contribute to solving the most pressing problems our world faces.
